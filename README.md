# Modeling a Game of Billiards

Goal of project:

Solve and model the equations of motion defining the typical "break" that begins a normal game of billiards. We will set up a initial model showing all 15 pool balls in their triangle shape and the cue ball a set distance away. By setting initial conditions for the force applied to the cue ball and the angle of the shot, we will attempt to model the resulting system of collisions, taking into account interactions between pool balls as well as interactions with the 4 cushions. If possible, we will also try to integrate the variable of 3d spin.
